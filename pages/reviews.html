        <h3>Brandie P's Testimony</h3>
        <h6>November 10, 2015</h6>
        <p>
          I came to The Dream Center in October 2014. I was homeless and
          unemployed. The guy I was living with had spent our rent money and I
          didn’t have a place to go. So my son and I went to the Dream Center.
          I was admitted and in less than a week I decided to leave. Big
          mistake, after being back on the streets a few days, I called Ms.
          Gail and asked to come back to the Center. She graciously allowed me
          and my son to return. This time I stayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since being at The Dream Center I have enrolled in college, I am in
          the work/study program. I am the first from my family to attend
          college. My son is tutored each day by the tutors who come to the
          Center. His grades have improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have surrendered my life to God and now have a real relationship
          with Jesus Christ. My son and I have been baptized. God has opened
          so many doors for me through The Dream Center. I thank God for
          leading me to the Center so I could learn more about Him and lead a
          better life for me and my son.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just want to thank Ms. Gail and her staff for all they have done
          for us.

        <h3>Rose M's Testimony</h3>
        <h6>November 6, 2015</h6>

        <p>
          I wanted to find a thank you card that says what I’m feeling but I
          couldn’t so I’m just going to share my thanks, through my testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was at The Dream Center for a total of 8 months. When I arrived at
          the Center in February of 2015 I was broken mentally and
          spiritually. I had come from Indianapolis to Tennessee to be with
          the man I had been in a relationship with for three years. But once
          I moved here I discovered he was not the person I wanted to be with.
          Everything he had done for me I thought it was out of love for me,
          but I soon found out what it really was, a form of mental abuse. I
          could see it becoming a physically abusive situation, so I Googled
          women’s shelters in Jackson and found the Dream Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had just started working for a temp company in January. I could
          have gone back to Indianapolis but I would have been unemployed and
          would have had to stay with someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I arrived at the Dream Center for my interview and met with Ms.
          Gail, I love you Ms. Gail. After telling her my story and being
          questioned as if by the police she said one thing that I will always
          remember, she said God sent me here for a reason. Upon entering the
          Center, I felt that I was o.k. A broken heart will heal, I thought I
          was very strong minded, independent, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept my temp job and did what was required of me chapel, chores,
          donations, etc. But through my journey I realized that God Loves Me,
          Rose!
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate Ms. Pam for having one on one Bible lessons with me
          before 8am on the days I was off. I wasn’t able to attend church on
          Sundays due to work so I always felt like I wasn’t getting it. But
          Ms. Pam would always say to me to pray and ask God to reveal His
          word to me. I had a problem with patience and just being still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ms. Phyllis welcomed me from day one with her bubbly personality,
          her warmth and comfort. She would motivate me so even on a bad day;
          she would talk about the Bible to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of all I want to thank Ms. Susan for being so encouraging to
          me. She never strayed from her faith. She always talked the talk and
          walked the walk of her faith. Thank God for the 180 class because it
          was through those classes and doing the homework that I began to be
          open and honest with myself. That is when my connection with God
          became marvelous. The weights I had been carrying were removed.
          Peace, love, joy, gratefulness, entered my life. THANK GOD I’M FREE!
          God gave me revelations about the way my boyfriend treated me was
          the same way I had been doing to other men for years and this broke
          me. I asked for forgiveness from God. Whenever I see anyone I hurt I
          will truly apologize. Thank you Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I totally and truly surrendered to God I have been set free. I
          have crossed over to a new world. No more of only giving Him pieces
          of me. He has all of me.

          The DreamCenter is an absolutely wonderful place filled with Godly
          women. They do their best to take care of each and every woman and
          child there. I was there for 9 months and I’m forever grateful for
          what they did for my baby and me. I learned about God and was
          changed forever from that experience. I was safe, the housing was
          beautiful and I left there with God on my side and a relationship
          with Him that I’ll always carry with me.
