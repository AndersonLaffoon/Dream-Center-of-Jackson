        <h3>Brandie P's Testimonial</h3>
        <h6>November 10, 2015</h6>
        <div class="mx-4">
          <p class="lead">
            I came to The Dream Center in October 2014. I was homeless and
            unemployed. The guy I was living with had spent our rent money and I
            didn’t have a place to go. So my son and I went to the Dream Center.
            I was admitted and in less than a week I decided to leave. Big
            mistake, after being back on the streets a few days, I called Ms.
            Gail and asked to come back to the Center. She graciously allowed me
            and my son to return. This time I stayed.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Since being at The Dream Center I have enrolled in college, I am in
            the work/study program. I am the first from my family to attend
            college. My son is tutored each day by the tutors who come to the
            Center. His grades have improved.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I have surrendered my life to God and now have a real relationship
            with Jesus Christ. My son and I have been baptized. God has opened
            so many doors for me through The Dream Center. I thank God for
            leading me to the Center so I could learn more about Him and lead a
            better life for me and my son.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I just want to thank Ms. Gail and her staff for all they have done
            for us.

        <h3>Rose M's Testimonial</h3>
        <h6>November 6, 2015</h6>
        <div class="mx-3">
          <p class="lead">
            I wanted to find a thank you card that says what I’m feeling but I
            couldn’t so I’m just going to share my thanks, through my testimony.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I was at The Dream Center for a total of 8 months. When I arrived at
            the Center in February of 2015 I was broken mentally and
            spiritually. I had come from Indianapolis to Tennessee to be with
            the man I had been in a relationship with for three years. But once
            I moved here I discovered he was not the person I wanted to be with.
            Everything he had done for me I thought it was out of love for me,
            but I soon found out what it really was, a form of mental abuse. I
            could see it becoming a physically abusive situation, so I Googled
            women’s shelters in Jackson and found the Dream Center.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I had just started working for a temp company in January. I could
            have gone back to Indianapolis but I would have been unemployed and
            would have had to stay with someone.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I arrived at the Dream Center for my interview and met with Ms.
            Gail, I love you Ms. Gail. After telling her my story and being
            questioned as if by the police she said one thing that I will always
            remember, she said God sent me here for a reason. Upon entering the
            Center, I felt that I was o.k. A broken heart will heal, I thought I
            was very strong minded, independent, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I kept my temp job and did what was required of me chapel, chores,
            donations, etc. But through my journey I realized that God Loves Me,
            Rose!
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I appreciate Ms. Pam for having one on one Bible lessons with me
            before 8am on the days I was off. I wasn’t able to attend church on
            Sundays due to work so I always felt like I wasn’t getting it. But
            Ms. Pam would always say to me to pray and ask God to reveal His
            word to me. I had a problem with patience and just being still.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Ms. Phyllis welcomed me from day one with her bubbly personality,
            her warmth and comfort. She would motivate me so even on a bad day;
            she would talk about the Bible to me.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Most of all I want to thank Ms. Susan for being so encouraging to
            me. She never strayed from her faith. She always talked the talk and
            walked the walk of her faith. Thank God for the 180 class because it
            was through those classes and doing the homework that I began to be
            open and honest with myself. That is when my connection with God
            became marvelous. The weights I had been carrying were removed.
            Peace, love, joy, gratefulness, entered my life. THANK GOD I’M FREE!
            God gave me revelations about the way my boyfriend treated me was
            the same way I had been doing to other men for years and this broke
            me. I asked for forgiveness from God. Whenever I see anyone I hurt I
            will truly apologize. Thank you Jesus.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Once I totally and truly surrendered to God I have been set free. I
            have crossed over to a new world. No more of only giving Him pieces
            of me. He has all of me.

          <p>My friend Gail who runs the Dream Center is the best!
            She has a love that knows no bounds when it comes to helping those who want help.
            She has found a place for my niece and now her daughter and I am beyond words of the transformation I see in
            them!
            I have watched Ms. Gail's dreams become a reality as many lives are changed through the Lord at the Dream
            Center.

            The DreamCenter is an absolutely wonderful place filled with Godly
            women. They do their best to take care of each and every woman and
            child there. I was there for 9 months and I’m forever grateful for
            what they did for my baby and me. I learned about God and was
            changed forever from that experience. I was safe, the housing was
            beautiful and I left there with God on my side and a relationship
            with Him that I’ll always carry with me.

            The Dream Center is an amazing place! They go above and beyond to help
            the women and also children that live there. You will never meet someone
            with such a pure heart as Ms. Gail. I recommend this place to anyone that
            is ready to surrender their lives to the Lord. They help heal the broken
            and mend your life. My life as well as my daughter's life have been
            touched by the generosity and love they have shown us during our time
            there. Please, as a community, keep your support for their mission. I
            will forever be grateful for the Dream Center. God bless.

            some of these ladies are. I am mother of five sons and have been a
            single mom most of the time. There was no place like this in Pensacola,
